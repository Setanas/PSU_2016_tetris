# PSU_2016_tetris

Tetris is one of the first year project in Epitech. <br/>
This is a game where you have what we call "tetromino" which are geometric shape falling from the top.<br/>
The goal is to form line with this tetromino on the bottom to win points. Each line formed will be destroyed.<br/>
The game have different levels where the tetromino fall faster. In this one the possibility to turn the tetromino is disabled.<br/>
