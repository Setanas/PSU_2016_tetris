# PSU_2016_tetris

Tetris is one of the first year project in Epitech. <br/>
This is a game where you have what we call "tetromino" which are geometric shape falling from the top.<br/>
The goal is to form line with this tetromino on the bottom to win points. Each line formed will be destroyed.<br/>
The game have different levels where the tetromino fall faster. In this one the possibility to turn the tetromino is disabled.<br/>

## Getting Started

This game is programmed in C on a Linux environment.

### Prerequisites

To compile we are using gcc.<br/>
The programm use the ncruses library.

### Installing

To install the game please use the Makefile to compile.
 
```
$> make
```

At the end you should have a "tetris" binary in your current folder.

## Creating your own tetromino

You can create your own tetromino by adding a file {name}.tetrimino in the folder "tetriminos".<br/>
(replace {name} by the name you want to give)<br/>
The file must have this format.
```
2 3 7
 *
**

```
2 is the length of the tetromino.
3 is the height of the tetromino.
7 is the color of the tetromino. (the color is between 1 and 7)
